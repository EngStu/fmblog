            <h1 class="section-heading">Welcome to Foundry-Matrix</h1>
            <p>The world is changing all around us. To continue to thrive as a business over the next ten years and beyond, we must look ahead, understand the trends and forces that will shape our business in the future and move swiftly to prepare for what's to come. We must get ready for tomorrow today. That's what our 2020 Vision is all about. It creates a long-term destination for our business and provides us with a "Roadmap" for winning together with our bottling partners. </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>

            <p>Our Roadmap starts with our mission, which is enduring. It declares our purpose as a company and serves as the standard against which we weigh our actions and decisions. </p>

            <p>To refresh the world...<br>
            To inspire moments of optimism and happiness...<br>
            To create value and make a difference.</p>
            Our Vision

            <p>Our vision serves as the framework for our Roadmap and guides every aspect of our business by describing what we need to accomplish in order to continue achieving sustainable, quality growth.
            </p>

            <h2>Please Note</h2>
            <p>Any similarity to Coca Cola's mission statement is <strong> strictly conincidental</strong>. We are both global, ambitious business empires. Similarities are inevitable! </p>
